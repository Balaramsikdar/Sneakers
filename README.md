I have created a online sneakers site using HTML,Css and Javacript.
I have added some click events to the colour change buttons which will change the colours of the shoes you want to buy and buy now button which will redirect you to the payment page when u click it.
I have added click event on the top of the page where you can click the type of sneakers you want to buy it will have a beautiful slide effect sliding or taking to that type of sneakers u clicked.
This site is also mobile responsive done using media query in css.
